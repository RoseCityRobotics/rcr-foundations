# Data Labeling with Label Studio

Data labeling (sometimes referred to as data annotation or dataset development) is an important step in your data science or machine learning practice. By adding meaningful information to your data through labeling, you can improve the accuracy of your models, identify and remove bias, and improve the efficiency of your machine learning and data science operations.

## Why Data Labeling Matters

Data labeling is crucial throughout the entire machine learning lifecycle:

### 1. Before you train a model
Many traditional Machine Learning models, especially those that use supervised or semi-supervised learning, require data that has been labeled with the correct answer so that the model can learn.

### 2. Evaluating the model
After the model is trained, it is important to evaluate its performance on the validation and test data. This step allows you to determine how well the model can generalize to new data and to identify any issues or areas for improvement. Labeling this data can look like validating the model output, or you can use test data that was previously labeled.

### 3. Fine-tuning the model
Based on the evaluation results, the model may need to be fine-tuned by adjusting the algorithms and parameters or by collecting additional data. This feedback loop can require the addition of new labeled data, and the labels and labeling processes themselves may be fine-tuned. This step may need to be repeated multiple times until the model's performance is satisfactory.

### 4. Continuously monitoring and updating
Even after the model is deployed, monitoring its performance and accuracy is important. Without regular updates, models can drift in the effectiveness of their predictions. Preventing this requires collecting new data to test and retrain the model as necessary. New, accurately labeled data is a critical component of this ongoing process.

### 5. Large Language Models
LLMs also benefit from data labeling. You can use data labeling to better understand how an LLM is performing on some data given a prompt, or use labeled data to implement an active learning loop to fine-tune your LLM. LLMs also make great labelers themselves. Either way, keeping a human in the loop with labeled data is essential to building robust, ethical systems.

## Label Studio: A Powerful Data Labeling Platform

**Label Studio** is an open-source data labeling tool that supports multiple data types including text, images, audio, video, and time series data. It's particularly well-suited for running on your Raspberry Pi 5 with Ubuntu 24, making it an excellent choice for robotics and ML projects.

### Key Features
