# Development tools

This folder contains guides for installing and configuring tools that
run on your personal machine (macOS or Windows) to complement the
embedded development work you do on the Raspberry Pi.  These tools
enhance your productivity and streamline collaboration.

## Guides

1. **[GitHub CLI](github-cli.md)** – Install the official GitHub
   command‑line tool on Linux, macOS and Windows; authenticate and
   perform common tasks like creating repositories and pull
   requests【144619821729735†L355-L368】.
2. **[Cursor AI editor](cursor-ai.md)** – Download and install the free
   Cursor AI code editor on macOS and Windows, and learn how to use it
   alongside existing editors.  Includes links to official docs and
   training videos.

Use these tools on your laptop while the microcontroller firmware and
robotics code run on your Raspberry Pi.
