# Git: Version Control Foundations

Version control is a fundamental skill for developers.
Git lets you track changes, collaborate with others, and maintain a
history of your work.  This folder contains a series of guides to
introduce Git from the ground up.

## Guides

1. **[Why Git](01-why-git.md)** – Understand what version control is,
   why Git is the industry standard, and key terminology.
2. **[Setup](02-setup.md)** – Install Git on your system (Linux,
   macOS, Windows) and configure your identity.
3. **[Essentials](03-essentials.md)** – Create a repository, add files,
   commit changes, and use a `.gitignore` file.
4. **[Branching & merging](04-branching-merging.md)** – Learn how to
   create branches, merge changes, resolve conflicts and undo mistakes.
5. **[Remotes & GitHub](05-remotes-github.md)** – Connect your local
   repository to GitHub or another host, push/pull code, and open pull
   requests.
6. **[Workflows](06-workflows.md)** – Adopt best practices for
   commit messages, branching strategies and code review.
7. **[GitHub CLI](07-github-cli.md)** – Install the GitHub command‑line
   tool (`gh`) on Linux, macOS and Windows, and learn how to
   authenticate and interact with GitHub from the terminal.
8. **[Resources](resources.md)** – Books, tutorials and interactive
   tools for further learning.

These guides assume no prior knowledge of version control.  They
introduce concepts gradually and provide examples you can try on your
own machine.
