# Server and project ideas

Your Raspberry Pi 5 running Ubuntu 24 can serve as the foundation for
numerous projects.  Here are some ideas to get you started.

## Web server

Run a web server like **Nginx**, **Caddy** or **Apache** to host
static sites, reverse‑proxy services or serve your own API.  The
Pi 5’s faster CPU and gigabit Ethernet allow it to handle a modest
amount of traffic【37†L66-L74】.  Use `sudo apt install nginx` to get
started.

## Database server

Install **PostgreSQL** or **MariaDB** to host a small database for
personal projects.  Combine with a web server to build a full stack.

## Network‑attached storage (NAS)

Set up file sharing with **Samba** (SMB) or **NFS**.  Use an
external SSD or NVMe to improve performance.  Newer Pi models with
USB 3.0 and PCIe (via a HAT) make excellent NAS devices【38†L85-L94】.

## Personal cloud

Run **Nextcloud** or **Seafile** to sync files, photos and calendars
across your devices.  These platforms provide a self‑hosted
alternative to commercial cloud storage.

## Home automation

Deploy **Node‑RED**, **Home Assistant** or similar frameworks to
control smart devices, schedule tasks and monitor sensors.  The Pi 5
has the performance to act as the brain of your IoT setup【38†L69-L82】.

## Fun projects

Host a **Minecraft** server, run retro gaming emulators, or create
digital art installations.  Ubuntu on Pi gives you access to the
same packages available on desktop Linux, so your imagination is the
limit【23†L0-L8】.

When experimenting with server software, always keep your system
updated and secure.  Use strong passwords, avoid default credentials,
and consider enabling a firewall (`ufw`) and automatic security
updates.
