# UNIX: Command‑Line Basics

This folder contains a series of short guides to help you become productive
with the UNIX command line.  Each guide builds on the previous one and
introduces core concepts such as navigation, file manipulation, text
editing and scripting.  These skills are essential when working on a
Raspberry Pi or any Linux system.

## Guides

1. **[Terminal basics](01-terminal-basics.md)** – Learn what a shell is,
   how to open a terminal and run commands, and how to get help from
   built‑in manuals.
2. **[Navigation & files](02-navigation-files.md)** – Move around the
   filesystem, create and remove files and directories, and use redirection
   and pipes to chain commands together.
3. **[Editors (nano and vim)](03-editors-nano-vim.md)** – Choose a
   text editor and start editing files.  Nano is ideal for beginners;
   Vim is more powerful once you learn some basics.
4. **[Permissions & processes](04-permissions-processes.md)** – Understand
   file permissions, make scripts executable, list running processes and
   manage them from the command line.
5. **[Shell scripting basics](05-scripting-basics.md)** – Write simple
   shell scripts that accept arguments and use variables.  Learn about
   shebangs and error handling.
6. **[Resources](resources.md)** – External tutorials, books and videos
   for further learning.

The guides are designed for absolute beginners but contain tips that
intermediate users will appreciate.  They assume you are using Bash
on Linux or macOS (or Windows Subsystem for Linux).  If you are on
Windows without WSL, consider using a terminal emulator such as PuTTY
as described in the Windows folder.
