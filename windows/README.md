# Windows Tools

This folder contains guides aimed at students using Windows laptops or desktops.  In robotics courses, you will often need a terminal application to connect to your Raspberry Pi over SSH.  We recommend **PuTTY**, a lightweight and open‑source SSH client.  Below you will find an overview of PuTTY usage and tips for managing connections.

## Guides

1. **[PuTTY terminal and SSH](putty-terminal.md)** – Learn how to download and install PuTTY, create a saved session to connect to your Raspberry Pi via SSH, and use PuTTY’s copy and paste shortcuts.  We reference the official PuTTY manual for correct mouse‑based copy/paste semantics【689115589285535†L43-L55】.

### Future topics

If your course requires other Windows‑specific tools (for example serial console applications or file transfer clients), future guides can be added to this folder.
